# FC RECIPE DATA
Current I am working in SAP PLM ABAP Cnsutant technical and Data Consultant. In this journey Data consulatant. I have work on Load of excel source file provided by my client. This excel file need to converted to file in format accepted by SAP PLM custom tool. One of source file recieved from client is for recipe data upload. I recieved a single sheet which will contain all recipe data. While loading Recipe data to PLM system we load in three step . 

1) First we Recipe header Data, This Data contain Description of Recipe like valid from , Engineeering change Number etc. 

2) Process data for Recipe , this data include Step to follow preparing Recipe  like stages , action etc

3) Formula data for recipe, this data will contain Ingredient data, this data will be used by system to calculate nutrient value etc.

(Sometime we will have only two step in recipe upload, we call this kind of recipe as flat recipe, this will hape single satsge , so no need to prepare process file)
